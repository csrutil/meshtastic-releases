# Meshtastic CJK Releases

Meshtastic firmware with Chinese, Japanese & Korean support - because why not have mesh networks that speak your language? üåè

## What's this about?

Just some unofficial firmware builds that let your Meshtastic devices display CJK characters properly. No more weird squares or broken text when your friends send messages in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean.

## The Fine Print üìù

- **Testing only**: This stuff is for testing/fun, not production. If it breaks something, that's on you
- **Unofficial**: This isn't from the official Meshtastic team - just a side project
- **No warranty**: It works on my machine ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
- **Don't sell these**: Please don't make money off these builds (though legally you could under GPLv3)
- **CJK code**: The CJK display stuff is my work. [Patch files here](https://github.com/whywilson/meshtastic-firmware/commit/fd672aa0e4172a28f2c4f06c9b8d1b4ab86aacb6#diff-efc04cdb1a550eb433fb6d101f1de4c358546a8b02a7e0b5b17256f60d6e0869) if you want to see how it works
